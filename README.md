# Stacked Genesis

## Overview

The project aims to provide a decentralized solution for individuals seeking exposure to experienced traders in hedge funds and investment banks. Leveraging the ERC1155 standard, the platform allows users to mint tokens representing $1000 USDT value each. These tokens can be staked to a trader, granting them the right to utilize the staked funds for trading activities.

## How it Works

- **Token Minting:** ERC1155 tokens are minted, each representing $1000 USDT value, and can be owned by individuals.
  
- **Staking to Traders:** Users can stake their tokens to traders, allowing traders access to the staked USDTs for a fixed period.

- **Liquidity Pool:** Staked tokens enter a liquidity pool, splitting in a 60-40 ratio (60% for trading, 40% as collateral).

- **Profit Distribution:** Profits generated by traders are sent to the liquidity contract. Distribution logic, customizable (e.g., fixed ROI), ensures fair returns for both traders and stakers.

- **Transparency and Control:** Stakers have transparency and control over their assets. They can choose their staking period and withdraw at will, maintaining flexibility without risking loss of funds.

## Research and Validation

- Conducted interviews with experienced traders who expressed enthusiasm for a streamlined platform to receive funds, reducing the need for extensive manual efforts in gaining trust and customers.
